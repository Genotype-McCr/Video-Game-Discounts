Introduction:

This is my first portfolio project for my professional data analytics journey. My analytical interest in the creation of this database was to
  identify whether a given discount for a pre-launch game was likely the best offer to occur before the game's release. This interest came to me when I missed
  out on an advantageous discount, seeing a more expensive lowest available price since. Part of the appeal of offering discounts is urgency. Though in contrast,
  when the discount sites are aggregated, often times when one discount expires, another takes its place--an ongoing discounted price ceiling. Consumers
  have poor means of gauging the price efficiency of a specific discount price (whether a better one is likely to occur, or in consideration of relative value).
  That's what this tool solves. A real problem for consumers solved using available data.
